# Mapquest
Breakout Room Activity 7.1 | Project Activity 3: Social Coding
In this activity, you will complete the following tasks:

-Select your project.
-Define the features that you commit to delivering in your application.

1. Select an Application Project
Your team has the choice to either make feature enhancements to an existing application, or to create a new application. Choose from the options described below.

Your team has been given a specific budget and a time constraint. The budget is managed by the product owner who has allocated funding for your team and the resources needed. Your manager has also scheduled a certain number of sprints to complete these features.

Option 1: Feature Enhancements - MapQuest
You have on your computer the code from "Integrate a REST API in a Python Application" (lab 4.9.2). Your manager has requested:

Moving the code from your computer to a collaborative version control system
Feature enhancements
Your manager has received a request from the marketing department to add new features to the MapQuest API application. You manager has given your team the task of making feature enhancements to this application. These feature enhancements can involve UI changes such as improving the formatting output (with colors, tables, etc.), providing the user with additional options such as data using the metric system or miles, or the type of data you provide to the user. Any other improvements that you think are appropriate will differentiate your work from the work of other teams.

Your manager would also like a list of other enhancements for a future revision. These are called backlog items. This backlog will be used for Project Activity 4.

Note: You will be using the final code from the lab, "Integrate a REST API in a Python Application". In this lab, you used the MapQuest directions API to retrieve JSON data, parsed the data and formatted it for the user.

Option 2: New Code - Create an IPv4/IPv6 Address Application
Your manager has received a request from the engineering department for a prototype of a new application that will provide IP addressing information to network technicians.

Search the internet for REST APIs that retrieve a user's current public IPv4 address and IPv6 address, such as ipapi.co or ipsstack.com. Using the public APIs, create a Python application that displays and formats the computer’s current public IP addressing information.

Depending on the API you select, you may also obtain geolocation information, the provider (ISP), the ASN (Autonomous System Number) of the ISP, and country code.

Your manager would also like a list of other enhancements for a future revision. These are called backlog items. This backlog will be used for Project Activity 4.

Note: The objectives and specific tasks of your project will depend on the options provided by the IP information API you choose.

2. Team Roles
Now that you have selected your application project, you will begin to identify how each team member can contribute to the project. There may be some team members with more experience in certain areas than others. This can be an excellent opportunity for cross-training. Remember, in a successful team people are supportive, encouraging and willing to help other team members.

At this point, the Scrum Leader will facilitate the process of:

-Identifying any persons on the team who may have knowledge, experience, or be an authority in a particular area or topic that is relevant to the project.
-Developing a strategy to accomplish the tasks.
-Creating a project plan to complete the tasks on schedule.
-Identifying the tools needed to move forward.

3. Project Workload and Project Status
Discuss project workload and the team's time commitment. Team members have other responsibilities, and setting expectations can help avoid any future conflicts and help ensure completing the project on-time. Your manager will supply you with the amount of time that has been budgeted for your tasks.

Throughout this project, it will be important for the scrum leader to manage individual workloads and the status of each project. Many times, this role may be assigned to an individual who has expertise in this area and whose sole job is project management.

The scrum leader will need to facilitate the process of:

-Maintaining a list of specific tasks.
-Breaking down tasks into smaller tasks if possible.
-Prioritizing each task.
-Managing the status of each task and any effect it might have on the completion of other tasks and the project.

Rubric/Deliverable: Provide a brief description of your team’s strategy for completing this project.

4. Set Up GitHub for Collaboration
As mentioned previously, your manager has requested that your team use GitHub to collaboratively work on your Python code.

Using GitHub.com:

-Create a repository
-Add collaborators
-Create branches for team members
-Work with pull requests, code review, merge, etc.

5. Application Development
In this part of the Project Activity, the application will be completed. Continuously refer to the processes and tools discussed previously. Continue to review these questions:

-Does the team continue to have open communications and positive attitudes?
-Are team members encouraging and supporting each other?
-Is the project being monitored with status updates of each task?
-Are there any conflicts or workload issues?
-Are the technical objectives achievable?

Your team is now ready to begin:

-Coding specific tasks
-Merging team code
-Verifying that the code works (quality assurance)

In addition, the scrum leader has the responsibility to ensure that the team is:

-Working collaboratively
-Completing tasks on schedule

6. Final Presentation
Create a presentation about the project you selected and your work completing the project.

Deliverable/Rubric:. Your presentation should include:

-Information about your application, covering what features your team included
-The reasons that your team decided on these specific features in your application
-Application code including comments and documentation. Your comments and documentation should be sufficient for any other team to be able to continue the project if required. Another team should be able to understand the application, your features and how to continue with the project.
-Demonstration of the application
-List of future enhancements (backlog)
-Reflection points – what issues have you faced while working on this activity, how did you find solutions, what have you learned, etc.

Team Activities and Reflection
Deliverable/Rubric: Your manager is interested in knowing how everyone worked together as a team. Here is a list of questions from your manager:

-What did you enjoy about working as a team? What worked well?
-What team problems did you encounter and how did you resolve them?
-What technical problems did you encounter and how did you resolve them?
-How was each team member held accountable individually and for the team as a whole?
-What was your team's decision-making process?
-Overall, how were the team dynamics and what were any lessons learned?

Final Deliverables
At this point, your team has completed Project Activity 3. Your team will present to your manager:

-Presentation
-Team activities and reflection
-Completed application code
-Link to GitHub repository for your work
-Completed rubric items
